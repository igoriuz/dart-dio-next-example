# Generating API Client with OpenAPI dart-dio-next client
This is an example on how to generate api clients with swagger definitions. It doesn't matter if you choose YAML or JSON as JSON is only a superset of YAML. 

## Prerequisites
1. Supported Java version is installed. [You can look it up here](https://github.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator#13---download-jar)
2. dart is globally available. The best solution is to install it via homebrew. Do not use Dart SDK which is shipped with Flutter.

## Generating client
Executing generate_client.sh is enough.
